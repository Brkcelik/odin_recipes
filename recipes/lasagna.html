            <ol>

                <li><strong>Cook the noodles: </strong> Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the cheese layer: </strong> Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna: </strong> Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake the lasagna: </strong>Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
